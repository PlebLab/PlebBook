# Nodes

## Core Lightning (CLN)

A specification compliant Lightning Network implementation in C. Core Lightning (previously c-lightning) is a lightweight, highly customizable and standard compliant implementation of the Lightning Network protocol.

## Eclair

A scala implementation of the Lightning Network. Eclair (French for Lightning) is a Scala implementation of the Lightning Network. This software follows the Lightning Network Specifications (BOLTs). Other implementations include core lightning, lnd, electrum, and ldk.

## Lightning Network Daemon (LND)

The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) - is a complete implementation of a Lightning Network node. lnd has several pluggable back-end chain services including btcd (a full-node), bitcoind, and neutrino (a new experimental light client). The project's codebase uses the btcsuite set of Bitcoin libraries, and also exports a large set of isolated re-usable Lightning Network related libraries within it.

## LNP Node: Lightning Network Protocol Node

LNP Node is a new Lightning Network node written from scratch in Rust. Actually, it's a suite of daemons/microservices able to run both Lightning Network (LN) as it is defined in BOLT standards - and generalized lightning codenamed "Bifrost": a full refactoring of the lightning network protocols supporting Taproot, Schnorr signatures, RGB assets, DLCs, multi-peer channels, channel factories/channel composability and many other advanced features. LNP Node operates using Internet2 networking protocols and specially-designed microservice architecture.

## Rust-Lightning

A highly modular Bitcoin Lightning library written in Rust. It's rust-lightning, not Rusty's Lightning! LDK/rust-lightning is a highly performant and flexible implementation of the Lightning Network protocol. The primary crate, lightning, is runtime-agnostic. Data persistence, chain interactions, and networking can be provided by LDK's sample modules, or you may provide your own custom implementations.

## Voltage

Enterprise-grade infrastructure for the Lightning Network. Scalability should be as fast and as easy as Lightning itself.
