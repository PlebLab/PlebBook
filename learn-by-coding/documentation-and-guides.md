# Documentation & Guides

### Bitcoin development philosophy

Bitcoin Development Philosophy is a guide for new Bitcoin developers who already understand the basics of concepts and processes such as Proof-of-Work, block building, and the transaction life cycle, and who want to level up by gaining a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s design trade-offs and philosophy. It should help new developers absorb the most important lessons of over a decade of Bitcoin development and discussion, and provide a context for evaluating new ideas (good ones and bad ones!).
