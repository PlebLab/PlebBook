# Grants and Donations

Support bitcoin developers so they can focus on building our future.

## Bitmex - Open Source Developer Grant Program

BitMEX, like other companies in the Bitcoin space, relies heavily on the (often-volunteer) work of dedicated open source developers. This work may be difficult, demanding, and often thankless. We believe it is the duty of corporations to help nourish the ecosystems in which they exist, giving back where possible to the projects from which they benefit – and from which their very business model may stem. Without the millions of free hours dedicated by open source developers powering everything from our operating systems to our web servers to Bitcoin itself, the BitMEX trading platform could not have been built.

## Superlunar Funds

Superlunar worked to strengthen web3’s infrastructure by empowering its contributors. Since 2020, we funded and supported the global builders, maintainers, and educators working toward the continued success of the Bitcoin Network and adjacent technologies. We considered proposals for individuals seeking sponsorship, project-based work, and large scale programs. Programs seeking sponsorship should be focused on educating and nurturing developer talent, ideally serving underrepresented areas of the ecosystem. ‍ Superlunar was an extension of the Gemini Opportunity Fund created in 2020 and plans to build upon its previous impact. Previous GOF grant recipients include foundations such as MIT Media Lab’s Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), projects like Mempool.space and multiple Bitcoin Core developers.
