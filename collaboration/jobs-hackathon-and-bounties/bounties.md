## Nostrocket

Nostrocket is an experiment in discovering the boundary conditions on sovereign human action that creates more value for honest and productive contributors than **any** other opportunity available to them. We do this by creating a universally applicable hill-climbing algorithm, executed by sovereign human action, and direct it towards discovering the optimal set of boundary conditions.&#x20;

## NYDIG Bitcoin Task Bounties

Bringing Bitcoin to all means also bringing Bitcoin development to all. NYDIG wants to incentivize Bitcoin development and expose new developers to the ecosystem. NYDIG is paying bounties for selected tasks in Bitcoin codebases. These are great starting points for those unaccustomed to Bitcoin development, as well as important but often under-prioritized by the existing community of developers.

## Stacker News Bounties

Our goal was to make it an extremely permissive feature and avoid overprescribing how to use it:

* The OP of the bounty can reward any child comment the bounty, including nested comments, and multiple comments
* The OP can pay a bounty on a comment with a click of a button (which behind the scenes is just a tip)
* The earning comment(s) for a bounty get a green bounty bag in their header
* The OP's past bounties will be displayed below their bounty posts so you can tell if they have a history of paying their bounties

You can view all bounties on the recent page by selecting the 'bounties' filter.
