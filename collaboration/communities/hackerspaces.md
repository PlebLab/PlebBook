# Hackerspaces

## ATL BitLab - Atlanta, GA

Co-working for bitcoin startups on the Atlanta Beltline. The city of Atlanta has many nicknames. One of them is transaction alley — 70% of US payments pass through Georgia. Meanwhile, the bitcoin lightning network enables cheap, near-instant settlement over the internet. This disruptive technology will reshape the payments industry in ways nobody can predict. ATL BitLab is the bridge, connecting transaction alley to a bold future atop the lightning network.
