### Bitcoin Product Community

The Bitcoin Product Community helps drive high-impact FOSS and commercial projects within the bitcoin ecosystem by creating a space for people to network, share ideas, seek feedback, and develop skills.

We believe this kind of collaboration can lead to greater talent recruitment, resource allocation, and fundraising efforts across the ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to see bitcoin cross the chasm (i.e. reach the masses) and become the best kind of money.

If you're looking to get involved with a bitcoin project and aren't sure where to start, join us on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Ztvwn8fycA) and find our work on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Product-Community).

From there, you can help discover, define, and prioritize problems for the community to tackle, get involved in a project, and join our [**bi-weekly community calls**](https://meet.jit.si/ComprehensiveSpecialistsRideStrangely).
