# Online Discussions

## Bitcoin Design

The Bitcoin Design Community [Discord](https://discord.gg/K7aQ5PErht) is an open space to discuss and explore everything bitcoin and design. Open standards are part of our foundation, so all of our work can also be found on [Github](https://github.com/BitcoinDesign).

Everyone is welcome to join and [participate](https://bitcoin.design/contribute). You can also follow along via our [newsletter](https://bitcoin.design/newsletter), [calendar](https://bitcoin.design/calendar), [social media](https://bitcoin.design/social-media), [BitcoinTV](https://bitcointv.com/a/bitcoin\_design/video-channels) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/BitcoinDesign).

## Bitcoin Product Community

The Bitcoin Product Community helps drive high-impact FOSS and commercial projects within the bitcoin ecosystem by creating a space for people to network, share ideas, seek feedback, and develop skills.

We believe this kind of collaboration can lead to greater talent recruitment, resource allocation, and fundraising efforts across the ecosystem. Ultimately, we want to see bitcoin cross the chasm (i.e. reach the masses) and become the best kind of money.

If you're looking to get involved with a bitcoin project and aren't sure where to start, join us on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Ztvwn8fycA) and find our work on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Bitcoin-Product-Community).

From there, you can help discover, define, and prioritize problems for the community to tackle, get involved in a project, and join our [**bi-weekly community calls**](https://meet.jit.si/ComprehensiveSpecialistsRideStrangely).

## [LND Developer Community](https://lightningcommunity.slack.com/join/shared\_invite/zt-1y3eup1mc-jDLCarR\~hOwI6X4un5Yz\_g#/shared-invite/email)

The LND Overview and Developer Guide aims to provide _just_ enough information about LND to enable readers to build applications. It starts with a conceptual review of the Lightning Network, before jumping into the important aspects of working specifically with LND.

## Lightning Dev Kit (LDK)

Moving forward members in the community should aim to exclusively post new stuff to Discord, while the Slack dies down over the coming weeks/months before officially closing. We believe semi-anonymous participation is an important feature for whatever chat platform we use. A few of the community access Discord via a Matrix bridge that seems to work well. You can join that [here](https://matrix.to/#/#ldk-discord:bitcoin.ninja).
