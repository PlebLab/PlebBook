## Chaincode Labs - Seminars

Once a week for 90 minutes, meet with fellow developers, challenge yourself, and receive guidance from current contributors. Weekly prep will take anywhere from 4-6 hours. Groups will have anywhere from 10-25 participants with rotating discussion groups of 3-5. Participants share a dedicated channel on the Chaincode Learning Slack workspace and those who complete the program are invited to our seminar alum community. Chaincode curates each cohort, arranges guest speakers, and provides ongoing support throughout the seminar. We do not provide moderators for small group discussions, but assign deputies to ensure an enriching experience. We expect everyone to attend every week. Participants are allotted one absence during the program. If you are absent a second time, we ask you withdraw from the group. We are happy to welcome you back in the future.
