# Technical Books

## Bitcoin: A Work in Progress by Sjors Provoost

With thousands of “crypto” projects out there, they say Bitcoin is old and boring, but nothing could be further from the truth. This book will guide you through the latest developments in Bitcoin, as seen through the eyes of one of its many developers. You’ll learn about the latest soft fork known as Taproot, the challenges of keeping open source software free of money-stealing bugs and malware, new ways to protect nodes against evildoers on the internet, how to deal with the ever-growing blockchain, and more! The book links to more than two hundred articles, videos, podcasts, and even the source code. And thanks to a tiny QR code next to every link, you’ll never have to type long URLs.

## Programming the Blockchain in C#&#x20;

I think the Blockchain is like the tree branch. For outsiders, it feels like a boring and useless collection of bits. For programmers and entrepreneurs, it is a marvelous raw material that can be shaped with our imagination. We give it meaning and purpose. Just as you need to know about wood to make a bow, spear or cane from a branch, you need to learn about programming to shape the Blockchain. My hope is that you will discover how much your skill and intelligence can shape that useless collection of bits. Let me warn you: learning about Bitcoin is like taking the red pill from The Matrix. You may find yourself ready to quit your job to work on it full time.&#x20;
